                    <h2>Flights & Cruises</h2>
                    <p>Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week. 
                        <br><br>
                        Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate small jets and propeller planes. 
                        <br><br>
                        Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on the island within the next few years. </p>

                    <p>
                        Taniti has a wide variety of lodging that ranges from an inexpensive hostel to one large, four-star resort. 
                        <br><br>
                        There are many small, family-owned hotels and a growing number of bed and breakfasts. 
                        <br><br>
                        All types of lodging are strictly regulated and regularly inspected by the Tanitian government.

                    <p>Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day. Private buses serve the rest of the island. 
                        <br><br>

                        Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors (helmets are required by law). 
                        <br><br>
                        Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable. 
                        <br><br>
                        Many tourists stay in the area surrounding Merriton Landing: this area is easy to explore on foot.</p>
