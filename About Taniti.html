                    <h2>Island Culture</h2>
                    <p>
                        Taniti's culture is a vibrant blend of indigenous traditions and tropical island charm, 
                        deeply rooted in its close relationship with the sea and rainforest. 
                        <br><br>
                        Local fashion reflects this easygoing, nature-connected lifestyle—lightweight, breathable fabrics in bright, floral prints are popular, 
                        along with handmade jewelry crafted from shells, wood, and volcanic stone.
                        <br><br>
                        Traditional Tanitian garments are still worn during cultural festivals and celebrations, showcasing bold patterns and natural dyes. 
                        <br><br>
                        As tourism has grown, modern styles have subtly blended with local customs, especially in areas like Taniti City and Merriton Landing, where colorful sarongs and casual resort wear mix effortlessly with traditional attire.
